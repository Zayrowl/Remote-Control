# Remote-Control
Question: 
In java, related classes can be grouped using Inheritance. However, for unrelated classes, we can group them using the concept of interfaces. You are asked to develop a java application that implements the idea of a universal remote controller. As you are aware, a universal remote controller can be used to operate different devices and these devices can even be of brands (e.g. Samsung TV, LG Aircondition, Panasonic remote fan, .... etc). Create a java interface that can be used to link at least 5 different classes that represent different devices from different manufactures. Then create a java application that uses an ArrayList of objects from those different classes and cycle through the array list calling each device "on" and "off" method. When each device is switched on and off, an appropriate method should appear on the screen.
